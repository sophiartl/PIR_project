### 27.10.2022 [ToDo]
[Spiral]
- Create way to input DB size from command line and preprocess

- compare setting differnce upload and download
[Simple]
- Running, do the same
- 

- how are params chosen.

## Objectives
- audience -> they want to know what the state of the art is and what are the different settings: for example, preprocessing was not something done before and this is done now -> compare before and after. 
- we want to know if this vcould work for otherproblemens (not the onethey defin in the paper)
- would it be feasible to deploy PIR in the near future
