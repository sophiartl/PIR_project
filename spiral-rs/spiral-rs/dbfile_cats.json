The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of [[Bubastis]], where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories.

The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from [[Magna Graecia]] dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegion]] and [[Taranto|Taras]] respectively, playing with their pet cats. The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was {{lang|grc-Latn|ailouros}}, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Aristotle]] remarked in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' that \"female cats are naturally [[Promiscuity|lecherous]].\" The Greeks later [[Interpretatio graeca|syncretized]] their own goddess [[Artemis]] with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] turns into a cat.<ref name=\"Engels2001\">{{Cite book |last1=Engels |first1=D.

The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people.
